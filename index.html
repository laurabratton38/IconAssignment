<p class="bigtext">Some news outlets’ headlines falsely link the movement to #DefundThePolice to rising crime. For example, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/27/us/fbi-murders-2020-cities.html">New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cities-reverse-defunding-the-police-amid-rising-crime-11622066307">Wall Street Journal</a> have recently published articles that investigate the spike in murders in the U.S. and, more specifically, New York City in the last two years. Journalists wrote that police became less engaged after protests this summer, and they think this is part of the potential explanations for rising homicides.</p>

  Why This Is Inaccurate:

<p>
  <p2 class="roboto">1) The police have not been defunded in New York City.</p2>
  <p>#DefundThePolice calls for divestment in police forces and investment in things like healthcare, housing, and education. Media articles have pointed to police budget cuts in the past year as a result of pressure from progressives. Between 2020 and 2021, the NYPD’s budget was cut, but not by much. Their funding fell from about $6 billion to around $5.2 billion - a decrease of only 0.39%. Meanwhile, there wasn’t a large investment in community development programs or education. The Department of Education’s funding increased 1% from 2020 to 2021. Similarly, the Department of Human Resources’ budget didn’t change much, decreasing by 0.06%.</p>
  <p> With such minimal changes to police funding and no significant investments in community programs, education, housing, or human resources, it's clear that New York City is hardly close to meeting the criteria that the #DefundThePolice movement calls for. At the same time, even if the police had been defunded in 2020, it would be difficult to measure the impacts of this change in such a short period of time.

<p3 class="roboto"> 2) While murders in NYC increased by about 30% from 2019 to 2020 and remained about the same into 2021, the number of homicides is low compared to numbers from earlier in the decade. </p3>
<p>A recent New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/upshot/murder-rise-2020.html">article</a> wrote, “The United States in 2020 experienced the biggest rise in murder since the start of national record-keeping in 1960.” But these numbers aren't put into context. Murder in 2020 was down 28% from 2001 and 76% from 1993, according to reports by the NYPD. Meanwhile, NYPD data shows that overall crime in New York City actually declined between 2019 and 2020, and that decline continued into 2021.

<p4 class="roboto"> 3) Police Engagement is not correlated with homicide rate.</p4>
<p>“Crime control is only a small part of policing,” says author Alex Vitale in his book, The End of Policing. His book shows that police spend most of their time on patrol, and detectives, who represent only a small fraction of police forces, often don’t solve cases. A study of the relationship between arrest rates (percent of offenses resulting in arrest), which was used as a measure for police engagement, and homicide rates between 2010 and 2015 in 53 U.S. cities found no relationship between the two. This means that the level of police engagement was not connected to the number of murders happening in those cities during this time frame. </p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2016, the violent crime rate dropped by 37%, according to FBI data. This decline occurred as the number of police officers went down from 242 officers per 100,000 residents to 217. These examples highlight that the number of police officers in the field and their level of engagement in policing do not impact the murder rate or the violent crime rate, generally.</p>
